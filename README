The two files ``test_utils.c'' and ``test_utils.h'' provide a simple
testing framework that can easily be integrated into a program
being written in the C programming language. It provides a framework
for executing a suite of tests as well as testing how procedures
manage dynamic allocations with ``malloc'' and friends. Finally, it
provides a way of testing whether or not assertions are thrown at
appropriate times when passing unsupported parameters to procedures
(for example, when the NULL pointer is passed to a procedure that
accepts a pointer but where the NULL pointer does not have any
useful meaning that can be associated with it, such as a procedure
that is meant to only mutate the memory behind the pointer).

See the ``example'' directory to see how the testing framework can be
integrated into a module to create a reusable library with tests
included.
