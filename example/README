This is a demonstration of a testing framework that was made in order
to make programming in C easier and less error prone. It includes a
simple way of constructing an executable that runs a test suite that
is meant to be handmade by the author, as well as tools for
determining the number of memory allocations currently active and
whether or not an assertion was thrown when bad inputs are given to
procedures. The implementation of this testing framework is defined in
the files test_utils.c and test_utils.h. The example code to test is a
dynamically allocated array that is defined in darray.c and
darray.h. The test suite for that example code is given in
test_darray.c and test_darray.h.
